# HoloGame P - "GearHeads"

## 1. Description

Welcome to the world of "GearHeads," an exciting steampunk-themed game! This adventure is set on a four-sided pyramid filled with mystical mechanisms and fascinating steampunk details. <br>

You are one of the four brave and fearless players, ready to face challenges and test your skills. Your main goal is to reach the top of the pyramid before the other players, using your abilities of movement, jumping, and climbing.

Prepare yourself for an adrenaline-filled experience in the world of steampunk as you fight for the prestigious spot at the top of the four-sided pyramid. Are you ready to accept the challenge? Enter "GearHeads" and showcase your skills as you climb towards victory!

## 2. Tasks

1. Build and design a 3D graphical interface for game selection in a steampunk style. <br>
2. Implement a 3D game tailored for display on a pyramid-shaped screen. Pre-made assets are allowed as long as they are free/open source and used in compliance with their licenses. <br>
3. Develop a graphical interface automation system (mobile device control, mapping various input elements to interface and game inputs). <br>
4. Establish automatic access point deployment. <br>
5. Create an update system. <br>
6. Prepare project documentation. <br> <br>

The graphical interface and game should be implemented using the Blender Game Engine and the Python programming language. The game style should be steampunk, and the mechanics and other elements are arbitrary, taking into account the platform's specific requirements. The automation of the graphical interface and mobile device control should be implemented using the Python programming language. The entire source code and documentation should be published on the project repository.
